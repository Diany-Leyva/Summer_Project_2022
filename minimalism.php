        <h2>The world of <span style= "color: #AF766E; ">Minimalism</span><br></h2>
           <p class='blogs'>Minimalism is about avoiding the unnecessary , <br>
           it's about simplicity, utility and elegance. It's all about “LESS IS MORE” <br>
           in terms of embracing the most of fewer things. The most common misconception <br>
           is that minimalists “suffer” and “sacrifice” while having less things and less interesting experiences.</p>
