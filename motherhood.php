           <p class='blogs'>Motherhood is the state of being a mother. A person <br>
           enters motherhood when they become a mother. This most commonly happens <br>
           when their child is born, but it can also happen through adoption or by <br>
           marrying or becoming a partner to someone with children. Motherhood is a <br>
           gender-specific version of the term parenthood.</p>
