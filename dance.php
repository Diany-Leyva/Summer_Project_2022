           <p class='blogs'>Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised <br>
           or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value. <br>
           Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, <br>
           or by its historical period or place of origin.</p>
